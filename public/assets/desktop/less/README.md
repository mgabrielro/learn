# GKV CSS

### The CSS/LESS architecture is based on ITCSS

ITCSS â€“ "Inverted Triangle CSS" involves visualising the entire CSS project as a layered,
upside-down triangle. This hierarchical shape represents a model that will help us order our CSS in
the most effective, least wasteful way.

### The HTML/CSS classes naming convention is based on BEM

BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It is a method used to construct CSS class-names so they are consistent, isolated, and expressive.
